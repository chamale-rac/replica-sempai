# Web Platforms Homework
In this project, where we need to make a copy of the style of some website we admire I choose https://dwl.media , that is a site of a design agency i found intereseting while lookingo for inspiration on https://www.awwwards.com

## Technologies used
1. üëæ Threejs: I use to include some 3d elements in the site. But in order to increase my productivity I use @react-three/fiber that is a React renderer for three.js.
2. ‚úÖ Eslint and Prettier: I used this to improve the workspace and project code quality and organization.
3. üöÇ Express: I use it in the configuration for use SSR.

Other technologies I use where:
-üíÖCSS modules that help to to scope locally by default all class names and animation names.
-üíæI use render.com, that is a "unified cloud to build and run all your apps and websites with free TLS certificates, a global CDN, DDoS protection, private networks, and auto deploys from Git..."
-Also I need to admit that as guide for implementing the server side render I use, not directly (cause I create my app with vite react normal template) but as example, the vite -> create-vite-extra -> ssr-react template that vite provides while creating a new proyect.

* Image of the replicated project. I definitely didn't implement the entire site, just a section of it. However, I try to pay attention to all the details, including a loading screen made manually with CSS. The background grid made with threejs, as well as the custom mouse which has "handmade physics". Also if you play around with the site you will see different animations on hover.

### Finally some images that proves that my site is using SSR:
